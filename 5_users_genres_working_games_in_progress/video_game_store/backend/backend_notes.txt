javascript async: represents asynchronous functions. asynchronous functions are functions that take time to execute 
( e.g fetching data), but do not interfere 
or block the execution of the rest of the program. these functions always return
"Promises".

 -- Promise: represents completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and          it's resulting value.

 -- await: used inside asynchronous functions to pause execution until a Promise resolves or rejects. 

since javascript is single-threaded, (one operation executes at a time), asynchronous functions are useful because they keep 
the app running while these operations execute.
